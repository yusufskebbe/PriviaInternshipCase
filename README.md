## Notes:
- I learn a lot of things while I was doing this task, I had some problems while I was exporting the svg files, so I only put the parts that I reached in the exported files.
- There is a tricky part in this project, you can click on the switch  button to get your %15 save, this feature valid for all the cards :)

- I used map function to make code more cleaner, instead of writing the same things in the component.
- I used state in the Header and Price components
- I wrap the hole project in the Home component, inside Home component there is Header, Body and Footer, inside Body there is Intro,Features,Analytics,MoreFeatures,Collabrate,Testimonial,Price
